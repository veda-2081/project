# MoodMate

Final project for the Building AI course
## Summary

MoodMate is an AI-powered mobile application that provides personalized mental health support to users. The app uses natural language processing (NLP) to analyze text messages and social media posts to detect signs of depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. It also uses machine learning algorithms to provide personalized recommendations for mental health resources based on the user’s needs and preferences. MoodMate can be used by anyone who wants to improve their mental health and is available on both iOS and Android platforms. However, it is important to note that MoodMate is not a substitute for professional medical advice, therapy, or medication 1.

## Background

Mental health is a growing concern worldwide, and many people struggle with depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. While there are many resources available to help people with their mental health, it can be difficult to find the right resources at the right time. MoodMate and Good Mood Coach aim to solve this problem by providing personalized mental health support to people when they need it the most. Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting? MoodMate and Good Mood Coach aim to help people with their mental health by providing personalized support and resources. Depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues are common problems that affect millions of people worldwide. My personal motivation for this project is to help people who are struggling with their mental health and provide them with the support they need to improve their well-being.


## How is it used?

MoodMate and Good Mood Coach can be used by anyone who wants to improve their mental health. The apps are available on both iOS and Android platforms and can be used on smartphones and tablets. Users can connect their social media accounts and text messaging apps to MoodMate to receive personalized mental health support. Good Mood Coach provides daily 3-5 minute training sessions to help people develop good habits that lead to the right choices on a daily basis.
This is how you create code examples:
```
Import the necessary libraries
import nltk from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

class MoodMate: def init(self): self.sid = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

def analyze_text(self, text):
    # Use VADER to analyze the sentiment of the text
    scores = self.sid.polarity_scores(text)

    # Return the sentiment scores
    return scores
```
Example usage
moodmate = MoodMate() text = "I'm feeling really down today." scores = moodmate.analyze_text(text) print(scores)

## Data sources and AI methods
MoodMate and Good Mood Coach use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to analyze text messages and social media posts to detect signs of depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. The apps provide personalized recommendations for mental health resources based on the user’s needs and preferences.

## Challenges

MoodMate and Good Mood Coach do not solve all mental health problems, and they are not a substitute for professional medical advice, therapy, or medication. The apps are designed to provide support and resources to people who are struggling with their mental health, but they are not a replacement for therapy or medication. It is important to seek professional medical advice if you are experiencing mental health issues.

## What next?

MoodMate and Good Mood Coach are just two examples of AI projects that aim to help people with their mental health. As AI technology continues to advance, we can expect to see more innovative solutions that provide personalized support and resources to people who are struggling with their mental health.

## Acknowledgments
